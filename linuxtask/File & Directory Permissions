# File & Directory Permissions

## Task Overview
In this task, we will create a directory and a file, then set the appropriate file permissions to manage access. The goal is to:
- Allow the owner to edit the file.
- Allow the group to read the file.
- Deny access to others.

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Create the directory `/devops_workspace`
To create the directory `/devops_workspace`, run the following command:
```bash
mkdir /devops_workspace


###2. Create the file project_notes.txt
Navigate to the /devops_workspace directory and create the file project_notes.txt:

cd /devops_workspace
touch project_notes.txt

###3. Set the Permissions
To set the permissions where:

The owner can edit (read, write, execute).
The group can read.
Others have no access.
Run the following command:   

chmod 740 project_notes.txt

Explanation of the permissions:

7 for owner: Read (4) + Write (2) + Execute (1) = 7 (full access for the owner)
4 for group: Read (4)
0 for others: No access (0)

###4. Verify Permissions
To verify the permissions of the file, use the following command:
ls -l project_notes.txt

Expected output:
-rwxr----- 1 <owner> <group> <size> <date> project_notes.txt

Where:

rwx represents read, write, and execute permissions for the owner.
r-- represents read-only access for the group.
--- indicates no access for others.

Conclusion
This task demonstrates how to create a directory and a file and set specific file permissions to control access for the owner, 
group, and others. Proper permission management is essential for security and access control in a Linux environment, especially for DevOps tasks.
